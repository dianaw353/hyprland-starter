## Nvidia users

Users that use hyprland has reported that they have been able use hyprland successfully on setups with NVIDIA GPU's.

As Hyprland dose not offically support nvidia devices I will try to make it earier to set up hyprland on nvidia GPU's but I cant garentee that everything will work as I do not own one of their devices. For more support please visit the following link: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/


## Some important key bindings
Comming soon

# Troubleshooting

## Missing icons in waybar

In case of missing icons on waybar, it's due to a conflict between several installed fonts (can happen especially on Arco Linux). Please make sure that ttf-ms-fonts is uninstalled and ttf-font-awesome and otf-font-awesome are installed with

```
paru -R ttf-ms-fonts
paru -S ttf-font-awesome otf-font-awesome
```


## Waybar is not loading

There could be a conflict with xdg-desktop-portal-gtk. Please try to remove the package if installed with:

```
sudo pacman -R xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
```
